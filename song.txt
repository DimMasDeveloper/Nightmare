But I'm tired
I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (this is all I know)

I will never break away (can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone

I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
